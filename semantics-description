The Object-Oriented MiniLanguage is an extension of the MiniLanguage
with the following syntax for class defintion added:

class CLASSNAME (p1, ..., pn)
  <stmt_list>
end;

or (for single inheritence):

class CLASSNAME (p1, ..., pn) : SUPERCLASS
  <stmt_list>
end;

The <stmt_list> within the class defintion contains the instance
variables and methods.

To create an instance of a class, the classname is called with the
initialization paramters (p1, ..., pn), which results in a Class
Object being returned.

To call a method of the class instance, you prefix the method call
with the class name, followed by a period such as:

classname.method(arg1,...,argn)
