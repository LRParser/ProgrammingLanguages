type 'make test' to run all of the sample inputs.  If there are no errors, than
all is well.

Adding tests
------------

Create an input file and place it in test/SampleInputs.  Copy the *exact*
output to a file of the same name and place it in test/answers.  Then, update
the makefile for the new tests.

If you change how any output is presented, new answer files must be generated.
